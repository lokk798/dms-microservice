# Document Microservice

This microservice handles document management within a microservices-based system. It supports creating, searching, categorizing, and assigning documents to departments, with secure access based on JWT authentication.
ðŸ“¤ **File uploads are delegated to the S3 Storage Microservice via `StorageClient`.**


---

## Authentication

All secured endpoints require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

The token must include:

* `sub` (subject): user ID
* `roles`: list of user roles (e.g., `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)

---

##  Features

* Manage Documents (create, search, upload files)
* Categorize documents
* Assign users to departments
* Access control based on roles (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_ADMIN`)
* File upload support (via `StorageClient`)
* JWT authentication filter

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java 17+
* Gradle

### Configuration

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: your_jwt_secret_key
  tokenPrefix: "Bearer "

  expirationTime: 86400000
```

Set up DB and storage configuration as needed.
